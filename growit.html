            <h3>Our Brief &amp; The Team</h3>
            <p>GrowIt! is an app that was already live for Apple &amp; Android devices when we undertook this project. In its existing state it was fully functional and visually appealing, but users weren't coming back for more. It lacked stickiness. Thus, we were tasked to:</p>
            <p id="brief">come up with new features and/or redesign the current ones that would result in a higher level of engagement - either to affirm that our ideas are correct, or give us new insight that we had not thought of.</p>
            <p>Two other UX designers and I did a deep-dive analysis of the current product. We pored through Google Analytics data, conducted usability tests of the existing app, surveyed around 200 people of all experience levels, and prototyped our solution. Though all three of us touched on all aspects of the project, my teammates focused on research, project management &amp; presentation-building while I focused on prototyping &amp; production.</p>

                We noticed users needed a way to organize different collections of plants, so we added a Pinterest-like way for them to group their own and others' plants into specific projects.

                We consolidated the previously-separate Search and Filter features and simplified it so users could quickly drill down to find exactly what they are looking for. Filters are applied one-by-one and the results update in real time.

                One of our interviewees put her biggest frustration with gardening succinctly: "Plants die and you don't know why." While the Plant ID feature already exists, we augmented it with a Plant Rescue feature for when you just can't figure out what those weird white spots are!

            <h4>Contextual Inquiry &amp; User Interviews</h4>
            <p>We sent out a web survey to gather insights about why people liked gardening, what their favorite plants were, and what kind of space they had for plants. We also visited several garden stores &amp; nurseries in the Chicago area and interviewed the staff &amp; customers there. Our biggest takeaway: folks the gardening community are super friendly and love to share their knowledge!</p>

            <p>We pulled a few insights from our survey about why people liked their favorite plants - <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>beautiful</strong>, and <strong>edible</strong> topped the list. From our interviews, we deduced a few principal reasons why people enjoy gardening overall:
              <ul>
                <li>They care about the environment and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Plants are like pets - they fulfill a nurturing instinct.</li>
                <li>It has intrinsic value and is a family tradition.</li>
                <li>It's rewarding to watch a plant grow.</li>
                <li>You can grow your own healthy food &amp; know exactly where it came from.</li>
                <li>They look good!</li>

            We used these personas as a framework for our solution - not only to figure out what would satisfy them individually, but what features would make them want to interact with each other and keep coming back to the app. With Ginny, for example, who uses a lot of social apps already, GrowIt! would have to provide a distinct value she couldn't get with Pinterest or Instagram.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Our experience with GrowIt! presented a unique challenge since we were refining an app that already existed. Though wireframes &amp; mockups were a necessary component, user research &amp; usability testing were paramount to the success of our iteration because the app's first development cycle didn't allow for that step.</p>
            <p>We delivered a product that was, by design, rather distinct from the existing app as we wanted to generate new solutions rather than reinvent the wheel. Though our client may not implement every feature verbatim to the way we designed it, our team is excited to see the influence of our designs in future iterations of GrowIt!</p>
